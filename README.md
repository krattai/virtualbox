virtualbox
==========

This is the lock step code of VirtualBox-4.3.20 as provided by Oracle Open Source Edition.

While the License document states that the majority of the code is copyright Oracle, it is very important to understand that VirtualBox _was_ released as GPL 2.0 prior to Oracle obtaining it and therefore, except for any unique code files, remain under GPL 2.0.

It is also important to note though, that some code is dual licensed of GPL 2.0 and CDDL 1.0 and people should be aware of any other constraints in regards to the dual license.

The source will be release here and as possible, other information and code files will also be posted here upon review of document licenses.
