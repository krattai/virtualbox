==========

This is the lock step code of VirtualBox-4.3.20 as provided by Oracle Open Source Edition.

While the License document states that the majority of the code is copyright Oracle, it is very important to understand that VirtualBox _was_ released as GPL 2.0 prior to Oracle obtaining it and therefore, except for any unique code files, remain under GPL 2.0.

The source will be release here and as possible, other information and code files will also be posted here upon review of document licenses.
